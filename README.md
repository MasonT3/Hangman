# Hangman
First Project made without any tutorials or help. Simple hangman game.

This is my first project and respository and learning git and working with others. Feel free to submit pull requests for adding features.
I plan on making a GUI for the game.

To submit a guess all you have to do is in the "HangmanRun" java file, type "hangman.guessLetter("A")". 
You can change the word by editing the "HangmanLogic hangman = new HangmanLogic("YOURWORD");"

Feel free to just leave advice or suggestions on making my code neater or more optimized.

Thanks,
